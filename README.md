# Frontend forms and nightmares

Tired of doing forms, form validation, and form backend management ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡

Here I will put and translate form validations, form data fetching into this single package from the pug view.

This will allow me to use the same functionality in both, the pug view, nextjs and probably somewhere else in the future.

# Rules

- [Frontend] This package is strictly for the frontend
